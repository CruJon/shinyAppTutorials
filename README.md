# shinyAppTutorials

This repo contains the code for the examples and demonstrations presented on my shiny tutorials site: [davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/). 

## Motivation

In my early days of learning shiny, I kept a document of all my tips and tricks. It worked nicely, but it quickly became too cluttered and scattered. I decided to create this project to organize the material in to a series of practical examples and to make it available for the wider R community.

## About the project

The available apps are listed in the following table. Not all demos have tutorials written and some are due for upgrades. There are also a few posts on the main site that aren't available here (yet).
