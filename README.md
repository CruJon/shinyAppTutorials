# shinyTutorials

This repo contains the code for the examples and demonstrations presented on my shiny tutorials site: [davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/](https://davidruvolo51.github.io/shinytutorials/). 

## Motivation

In my early days of learning shiny, I kept a document of all my tips and tricks. It worked nicely, but it quickly became too cluttered and scattered. I decided to create this project to organize the material in to a series of practical examples and to make it available for the wider R community.

My interests are in web accessibility, data visualization and communication of results, and good design practices. Many of these tutorials focus heavily on html, css, and javascript, but I will try to keep things simple and provide links for further reading. Questions are welcome!

All of the available tutorials are listed below and there are more on the way. Not all demos have available (however, I'm currently updating posts and writing new posts for all examples) on github have tutorials written and some are due for upgrades (just about complete). Suggestions, comments, ideas for improvement are always warmly welcomed.

## The Tutorials

The available apps are listed in the following table. Not all demos have tutorials written and some are due for upgrades. There are also a few posts on the main site that aren't available here (yet).

## Resources

Many of the tutorials use css and javascript, as well as html to specifc layouts and custom designs rather than shinyUI functions. These are good skills to have and will come in handy in future shiny development. Here are some links that you may find useful.
