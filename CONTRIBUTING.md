## Background

### About the project

Why did I start this project? In my early days of learning shiny, I kept a document of all my tips and tricks. It worked nicely, but it quickly became too cluttered and scattered. I decided to create this project to organize the material in to a series of practical examples and templates available for the wider R community.

I write tutorials on things that I'm learning on at the moment or if there is something that I'm curious if shiny can do. My interests are in web accessibility, data visualization and communication of results, as well as frontend development and good design practices. Many of these tutorials focus heavily on html, css, and javascript, but I will try to keep things simple and provide links for further reading.

### The structure of the project

There are two repos to this project.

1. [shinyAppTutorials](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinyAppTutorials)
2. [shinytutorials](https://github.com/davidruvolo51/shinytutorials)

The `shinyAppTutorials` repo contains all of the shinyapps and examples, as well as all related code discussed in the tutorials (e.g., css, js,  etc.). All written tutorials are stored in the `shinytutorials` repo. The static site is built with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and all tutorials are written in markdown. More information on each repo can be found below.
